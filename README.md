# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

🚀 **An AI-based system for diagnosing diseases using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.**

---

## **📖 Overview**  
The **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System** leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to enhance medical diagnostics. It analyzes **patient data, medical images, and symptoms** to assist healthcare professionals in accurate disease detection.  

## **🛠 Features**  
✅ **Disease Prediction:** AI models trained for **Diabetes, Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Parkinson’s, and Thyroid disorders**.  
✅ **Medical Image Analysis:** Uses **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to process medical images.  
✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Extracts insights from medical records.  
✅ **Explainable AI (XAI):** Enhances transparency in AI predictions.  
✅ **Cloud Integration:** Supports remote diagnostics.  
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Built using **Streamlit**.
